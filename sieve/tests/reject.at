Look, I'm sorry about the whole anvil thing, and I really
didn't mean to try and drop it on you from the top of the
cliff.  I want to try to make it up to you.  I've got some
great birdseed over here at my place--top of the line
stuff--and if you come by, I'll have it all wrapped up
for you.  I'm really sorry for all the problems I've caused
for you over the years, but I know we can work this out.
